From PCT Int. Appl. (2018), WO 2018177746 A1 20181004, Language: English, Database: CAPLUS

The present invention relates to the field of therapeutic treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  Polycystic ovary syndrome, PCOS, is the most common female reproductive disorder against which no therapeutic soln. is available, beyond changes in the lifestyle.  The inventors have now shown by using in vivo preclin. models, that individuals affected with PCOS have an abnormal elevated prodn. of GnRH and that this elevated prodn. of GnRH was transmitted to their offspring that also develop PCOS.  Further, by examg. Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) levels in a cohort of pregnant PCOS and control women, the inventors have found that AMH concns. are significantly higher in PCOS women as compared to healthy women during the second trimester of gestation.  These unexpected findings has allowed conceiving both prevention and treatment therapeutic strategies based on the administration of GnRH antagonists.  Esp., the present invention relates to a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist for its use in a woman affected with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) for preventing the occurrence of PCOS in the offspring of the said woman.  Even more interestingly, the present invention relates to a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist for its use to rescue ovulation and fertility in postpuberal PCOS affected individuals.

42. Radiation enhanced macromolecular delivery of therapeutic agents for chemotherapy technologyBy Ray, Abhijit; Ghandehari, Hamidreza
From U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. (2012), US 20120197060 A1 20120802, Language: English, Database: CAPLUS

Described herein are anti-cancer compds. composed of a macromol. comprising (1) at least one anti-cancer agent directly or indirectly bonded to the macromol. and (2) at least one high Z element directly or indirectly bonded to the macromol. that is capable of producing Auger electrons upon exposure to X-ray energy.  When the compds. are exposed to low energy X-ray (e.g., kilo eV KeV) Auger electrons are produced by the high Z elements present in the compd.  Because lower energy is required when compared to typical radiotherapy, which uses therapeutic X-ray energy in the million eV range (MeV), the subject experiences lower collateral damage when compared to radiation therapy.  Addnl., the presence of the anti-cancer agent provides a second mechanism for killing cancer cells.  Methods for making and using the anti cancer compds. are also described herein.

Anti-cancer compds. composed of a macromol. comprising (1) at least one anti-cancer agent directly or indirectly bonded to the macromol. and (2) at least one high Z element directly or indirectly bonded to the macromol. that is capable of producing Auger electrons upon exposure to X-ray energy are described.  When the compds. are exposed to low energy X-ray (e.g., kilo eV KeV), Auger electrons are produced by the high Z elements present in the compd.  Because lower energy is required when compared to typical radiotherapy, which uses therapeutic X-ray energy in the million eV range (MeV), the subject experiences lower collateral damage when compared to radiation therapy.  Addnl., the presence of the anti-cancer agent provides a second mechanism for killing cancer cells.  Methods for making and using the anti not cancer compds. are also described herein.  Thus, synthesis of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer attached with two drug combination (cisplatin and docetaxel) by an enzymically degradable tetrapeptide GFLG was described.  The polymer was attached to a targeting moiety by the enzymically nondegradable dipeptide GG.

139. Methods and related compositions using intracellular granularity-increasing agents for the treatment of cancerBy Thompson, Todd A.; MacKenzie, Debra; Oprea, Tudor I.; Sklar, Larry A.; Edwards, Bruce S.; Haynes, Mark
From PCT Int. Appl. (2009), WO 2009148623 A2 20091210, Language: English, Database: CAPLUS

A method for treatment and/or prevention of cancer comprises administering agents which cause increased intracellular granularity in cancer cells, at least in an amt. sufficient to inhibit proliferation of such cells and preferably in an amt. sufficient to lead to cancer cell death.  The method is particularly directed to refractory cancer, particularly hormone refractory prostate cancer.  The agents identified cause increased intracellular granularity in the cancer cells, and also convert adherent cancer cells to nonadherent cancer cells, leading to cancer cell death.  Using the invention, cancer cells undergo increased intracellular granularity at relatively low agent concns., while also inhibiting cell proliferation.  Increased concns. lead to conversion of adherent cancer cells to nonadherent cancer cells, then to cell death.  While the exact mechanism of cancer cell degrdn. and death is not completely understood, the treated cancer cells, including refractory prostate cancer cells, give indications of cell death through an autophagic mechanism.  Pharmaceutical compns. related to the methods are also disclosed.

The present invention provides compns. of GnRH related compds. that are suitable for oral administration, injectable administration and other forms of administration wherein the gelling characteristics of the compn. are a factor.  The compns. of the present invention comprise a therapeutically effective amt. of one or more GnRH related compd., and a sufficient amt. of at least one anti-gelling agents to reduce the gelation of the GnRH related compd.  The present invention also provides processes for prepn. of a compn. of one or more GnRH related compd., wherein the process comprises mixing the GnRH related compd. with one or more anti-gelling agents, wherein the anti-gelling agent comprises a medium chain fatty acid salt, or an ester, an ether, or a deriv. of a medium chain fatty acid and has a carbon chain length of from about 4 to about 20 carbon atoms or is a surface active agent.  Thus, 10 mg acyline is transferred into 200 mL volumetric flask; 100 mL pH 6.8 buffer preheated to 37 ¡ãC and 0.6 mg/mL sodium caprate is added to the flask to prep. a 0.1 mg/mL acyline sample; Tween 80 is added to prep. a 0.1 mg/mL acyline soln. with 1% Tween 80; samples are shaken in a temp. controlled water bath at 37 ¡ãC; 5 mL samples are taken at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 120 min after mixing acyline with the buffer soln.; it was found that sodium caprate alone at a concn. below the CMC is insufficient to reduce the gelation of acyline; the addn. of 1 % Tween 80 successfully reduces the gelation.

Compns. which act synergistically to inhibit the growth of cancer cells and methods of use thereof are disclosed.  Thus, when HCT116 cells were treated with a combination (1:25 ratio) of C 1368 and erlotinib (1:25 ratio), the IC50 value of erlotinib decreased >3 fold (from 37.3 ¦ÌM to 12.3 ¦ÌM) and the IC50 value for C1368 decreased >4 fold (from 2.3 ¦ÌM to 0.5 ¦ÌM) as compared to treatment with either drug alone; similarly, combination treatment of a second K-Ras-mutated cell line, DLD1, with C1368 and erlotinib resulted in an even greater fold decrease of the IC50 values of the single agents, with IC50 reduced from 71.7 ¦ÌM to 13.8 ¦ÌM for erlotinib, and from 2.7 ¦ÌM to 0.5 ¦ÌM for C1368; synergy is evident for the C1368 and erlotinib combination in both cell lines under both ED 50 (ED 50) and ED 75, but not at ED 90; the lack of synergy at ED 90 is likely due to off-target kinase inhibition, which can occur when C1368 is given at high concns.

The invention relates to fusion constructs, methods of using fusion constructs and methods of treating undesirable or aberrant cell proliferation or hyperproliferative disorders, such as tumors, cancers, neoplasia and malignancies.  A fusion construct comprises (i) a first domain consisting of a 12 to 28 amino acid sequence and (ii) a second domain consisting of an amino acid sequence comprising a binding moiety that binds to a receptor, ligand, or antigen.  Thus, peptide KFAKFAKKFAKFAKKFAKQHWSYGLRPG [Phor18-LHRH (338613)] was effective in vivo in destroying breast cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer xenografts.  Phor18-LHRH (338613) caused tumor necrosis in treated mice, with necrosis being evident as early as 1 h post injection.  Phor 18-LHRH (338613) was effective as a single weekly treatment regimen inducing necrosis and causing tumor wt. redn.  As a multiple weekly regimen eradication of tumors was more evident including destruction of residual tumor cells.  Phor18-LHRH (338613) caused redn. in LHRH receptor levels after treatment, consistent with target cell destruction.

Esterification of (R)-2-aminobutyric acid and reductive condensation with cyclopentanone gave cyclopentylamine II, which underwent regioselective substitution of 2,4-dichloro-5-nitropyrimidine and reductive heterocyclization to form pteridinone III.  N-Methylation of III followed by substitution with 4-amino-3-methoxybenzoic acid and amidation with 1-methyl-4-aminopiperidine resulted in the formation of aminopteridinone IV.  A combination of suboptimal doses of irinotecan and compd. IV shows an additive/synergistic effect in a human colon carcinoma model and is well tolerated.  Meanwhile, compd. IV acts at least additively with docetaxel in a human non-small cell lung carcinoma model and not antagonistically with gemcitabine in a human adenocarcinoma model.

Sustained delivery formulations comprising a water-insol. complex of a peptidic compd. (e.g., a peptide, polypeptide, protein, peptidomimetic or the like) and a carrier macromol. are disclosed.  The formulations of the invention allow for loading of high concns. of peptidic compd. in a small vol. and for delivery of a pharmaceutically active peptidic compd. for prolonged periods, e.g., one month, after administration of the complex.  The complexes of the invention can be milled or crushed to a fine powder.  In powd. form, the complexes form stable aq. suspensions and dispersions, suitable for injection.  In a preferred embodiment, the peptidic compd. of the complex is an LHRH analog, preferably an LHRH antagonist, and the carrier macromol. is an anionic polymer, preferably CM-cellulose.  Methods of making the complexes of the invention, and methods of using LHRH-analog-contg. complexes to treat conditions treatable with an LHRH analog, are also disclosed.  Thus, 50 mg of PPI-149 was dissolved in 2 mL of 5% mannitol and mixed with 2 mL of 0.5% CM-cellulose.  The mixt. was stirred and immediately yielded a white ppt.  The suspension was frozen and lyophilized to dryness to yield a PPI-149 sustained delivery complex.

269. Sustained release salts of pharmaceutically active peptides and their productionBy Bauer, Horst; Deger, Wolfgang; Sarlikiotis, Werner; Damm, Michael
From PCT Int. Appl. (2000), WO 2000047234 A1 20000817, Language: English, Database: CAPLUS

Substained delivery pharmaceutical compns. comprise a water insol. salt of a pharmaceutically active ionic peptide and a counterionic carrier macromol.  The peptide may be an LHRH antagonist such as cetrorelix and the macromol. may be an anionic polysaccharide such as CM-cellulose.  The salt is prepd. using ion exchangers to sep. remove the counterions from the peptide and the carrier macromol. thereby forming free peptide/macromol. ions.  These free peptide and macromol. ions are then combined to form the water insol. peptide-macromol. salt.  A lyophilizate of cetrorelix-CM-cellulose salt was prepd.

271. Bioimplant formulations containing stearinBy Trigg, Timothy Elliot; Walsh, John Desmond; Rathjen, Deborah Ann
From PCT Int. Appl. (2000), WO 2000004897 A1 20000203, Language: English, Database: CAPLUS

A pharmaceutical and/or veterinary formulation comprising about 2-30 % (wt./wt.) of at least 1 active agent, about 0.5-20.0% of a pore-forming agent and the balance stearin.  Such formulations provide sustained release of the at least one active agent in humans and other animals for periods of 7 days up to about 2 yr.  Stearin and lecithin were mixed with freeze-dried deslorelin.  The mixed material was extruded by using a ram extruder and was equilibrated at 55¡ã.  The product was then extruded at a rate of 3 g over a 30-s period and cooled and the the long rods produced were sectioned into lengths of the required wt.  In dissoln. tests, after an initial rapid release of deslorelin, a sustained release extending over a prolonged period (110 days) was achieved.  The av. daily rate of deslorelin release during the sustained release period was within the range 50-2 ¦Ìg/day.
